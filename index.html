        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

        <p>Hello! I am TJ, I am currently a student in Code Fellows
         201. I am fairly new to coding, I took CS101 in college but I 
         wasn't any good at it and left it alone, until now! Since
         then I worked many odd jobs, from maintenance to pizza delivery
         to warehouse labor. My working experience helped me develop
         as a problem solver, helping coding "click" in a way it
         didn't a decade ago. So now, with renewd confidence, I am 
         ready to attack this challenge once again!</p>
